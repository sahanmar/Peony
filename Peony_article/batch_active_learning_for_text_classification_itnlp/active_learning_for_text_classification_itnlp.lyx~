\begin_layout Abstract
Supervised learning of classifiers for text classification and sentiment
 analysis relies on the availability of labels that may be either difficult
 or expensive to obtain.
 A standard procedure is to add labels to the training dataset sequentially
 by querying an annotator until the model reaches a satisfactory performance.
 Active learning is a process that optimizes unlabeled data records selection
 for which the knowledge of the label would bring the highest discriminability
 of the dataset.
 Batch active learning is a generalization of a single instance active learning
 by selecting a batch of documents for labeling.
 This task is much more demanding because plenty of different factors come
 into consideration (i.
 e.
 batch size, batch evaluation, etc.).
 In this paper, we provide a large scale study by decomposing the existing
 algorithms into building blocks and systematically comparing meaningful
 combinations of these blocks with a subsequent evaluation on different
 text datasets.
 While each block is known (warm start weights initialization, Dropout MC,
 entropy sampling, etc.), many of their combinations like Bayesian strategies
 with agglomerative clustering are first proposed in our paper with excellent
 performance.
 Particularly, our extension of the warm start method to batch active learning
 is among the top performing strategies on all datasets.
 We studied the effect of this proposal comparing the outcomes of varying
 distinct factors of an active learning algorithm.
 Some of these factors include initialization of the algorithm, uncertainty
 representation, acquisition function, and batch selection strategy.
 Further, various combinations of these are tested on selected NLP problems
 with documents encoded using RoBERTa embeddings.
 Datasets cover context integrity (Gibberish Wackerow), fake news detection
 (Kaggle Fake News Detection), categorization of short texts by emotional
 context (Twitter Sentiment140), and sentiment classification (Amazon Reviews).
 Ultimately, we show that each of the active learning factors has advantages
 for certain datasets or experimental settings.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supervised learning of classifiers relies on the availability of class labels
 which often involves a human annotator for a majority of NLP tasks.
 This can be costly for large datasets.
 Active learning is a strategy designed to minimize this cost by automatic
 selection of those unlabeled documents that are expected to bring useful
 information for the classifier.
 Advantages of this approach have been demonstrated even for classical methods
 such as SVM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "tong2001support"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The most conventional active learning strategies select only one unlabeled
 document after each training round to query due to the simplicity of its
 selection.
 The next query document is selected only after the first one is labeled
 and the model retrained, which means that the annotator has to wait for
 retraining.
 This impractical strategy can be avoided if the active learning algorithm
 selects a batch of documents.
 Novel methods for batch active learning appear frequently, each demonstrating
 advantages on their benchmark data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various comparative studies have been performed recently with various focus
 and results.
 Batch active learning was studied in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dor2020active"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for only one size of the batch (50 documents per query).
 Large sensitivity to the type of dataset was reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "prabhu2021multi"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where different methods won for different data.
 Large variability of the results was also observed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jacobs2021active"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "schroder2021uncertainty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the min-margin strategy was shown to be competitive with the prediction
 entropy-based method on a range of embeddings.
 The comparative studies shared similar properties, such as a fixed network
 for embeddings (improvement with retraining can be expected 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "margatina2021bayesian"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 but may be too costly).
 All studies also assume a cold start, i.e.
 completely new initialization of the classifier after each round of querying.
 This is motivated by the fear of overfitting, which was demonstrated in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hu2018active"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for hot start, i.e.
 continuation of training of the classifier.
 A compromise in the form of warm-start, i.e.
 adding noise to the weights of the previous classifier, was proposed in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this contribution, we take a different approach to benchmarking of the
 batch active learning algorithms.
 Specifically, we decompose the algorithms into their building blocks: i)
 the size of the minibatch, ii) acquisition function, iii) representation
 of uncertainty of the classifier, and iii) initialization of the network.
 This approach allows us to quantify contribution of each of the building-block
 and combine them in previously untested versions.
 This allows us to demonstrate the following contribution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We present an extension of the Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)
 approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "citovsky2021batch"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to the Bayesian setting by replacing the min-margin with a Bayesian acquisition
 function, such as BALD 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "houlsby2011bayesian"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is a novel combination that has not been tested before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We show that performance of various methods is clustered based on particular
 building blocks of the method.
 Thus indicating that active learning methods may be tailored for each target
 application.
 A good example of Bayesian methods lies in estimating the distribution
 of neural networks which performed the best on Fake news but showed the
 same results on other datasets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In a large scale study we demonstrate that warm start is often beneficial
 and even simple methods (such as single neural network with entropy acquisition
) provide results competitive to, or better than, complex active learning
 schemes.
 We also show that cold start approaches reach the same or even worse results
 than the aforementioned warm start techniques.
 This is encouraging for practitioners that are interested in the methodology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper is organized as follows.
 In Section 2, we briefly review all tested factors of batch active learning.
 The experimental setup of the sensitivity study is described in Section
 3 and the results are reported in Section 4.

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the paper, we will use the RoBERTa embedding 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to represent documents in the feature space.
 RoBERTa is a modified BERT transformer model

 that achieved comparable performance to BERT in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and outperformed all other embeddings in

.
 Representation of the k-th text document 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{k}$
\end_inset

 is calculated as the mean value from sentence embeddings of all sentences
 in the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of document classification is to find a classifier 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{y}}=\mathbf{y}(\theta,\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 predicting the class label for each document representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 In a supervised setting, the classifier parameters are found on a training
 set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{x}_{k},\mathbf{y}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}$
\end_inset

 by matching the prediction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}(\theta,\mathbf{x}_{k})$
\end_inset

 with the provided label 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}_{k}$
\end_inset

 for each document.
 We are concerned with binary classification for simplicity, however, an
 extension to multiclass is straightforward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that for the full corpus of text documents 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

, only a small initial set of labels 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, is available.
 The full set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 is thus split into the labeled, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, and unlabeled parts, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{u}^{(0)}=\mathbf{X}\backslash\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, the training set in the first round is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{(0)},\mathbf{Y}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 Active learning is defined as a sequential extension of the training data
 set following a simple iterative strategy in algorithm 1.

 This probability is conditioned on the parameter, and thus captures only
 aleatoric uncertainty.

 Batch selection strategy

When only one sample is to be selected, it is optimal to choose the one

 documents for off-line labeling.
 Strategies that try to approximate this selection using greedy search

\begin_layout Standard
Each active learning experiment was initialized by the training set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{(0)},\mathbf{Y}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $10$

 samples.
 The active learning strategy was set to sample 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 samples with a discrete set of variants, 
\begin_inset Formula $b=10,20,50,100$
\end_inset

.
 The active learning was run until 1000 samples were labeled, i.e.
 making a different number of steps for each batch size (10 iterations for
 
\begin_inset Formula $b=100$
\end_inset

, 20 for 
\begin_inset Formula $b=50$
\end_inset

, etc.).
 The batch selection follows the 𝜖 -greedy approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, i.e.
 the samples selected by the acquisition function are accepted with probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $𝜖=\frac{\exp(l-3)}{\exp(l-3)+1}$
\end_inset

.
 A batch of random documents is selected for labeling if not accepted.
 The AUC is evaluated on the remaining part of the selected dataset (i.e.
 on the 9990 text documents in the first evaluation).
 The reported AUC values are averaged over 
\begin_inset Formula $5$

 independent runs.

\begin_layout Standard
The initial number of epochs for the first iteration is 2500 for all algorithms.
 The same number is used for the cold start strategy in each iteration.
 The training of the warm start strategies is run for 150 epochs, with weights
 perturbation noise of variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0.3$

 for both MC dropout and DEnFi.
 Both DEnFi and MC Dropout generate 5 ensemble members.
 The key difference is in computational complexity, while DEnFi has to tune
 the parameters for each ensemble member, the MC dropout does it for only
 one network and generated ensemble members by 5 different realizations
 of the dropout mask.

 on the test data (i.e.
 the documents not present in the training set).
 The algorithms were compared after 1000 acquired labels.
 The algorithms with smaller batch sizes thus benefited the from higher
 number of retrainings.
 To reduce the influence of stochastic initialization and training, the
 AUCs were run 5 times and averaged.
 Even then, the difference between the algorithms was sometimes marginal.
 To show the effect of various factors on the performance, we sorted the
 AUC and assigned a rank of each method accordingly.
 I.e.
 the best performing method has rank 1, second rank 2, etc.
 This approach allows the comparison of various methods across multiple
 datasets

The effect of parameter uncertainty (Bayesian approach) is the most costly
 to evaluate, due to the high computational demand of the ensemble approach
 (DEnFi).
 Therefore, we have evaluated all algorithm variants only for batch size

.
 The results are displayed in Figure

.
 The advantage of the Bayesian approach is evident only for the Fake News
 dataset.
 This behavior is a result of a good neural network parameters distribution
 estimate.
 However, in other datasets, DEnFi performed as good as a single neural
 network, and is not worth the computational cost.
 As a result, the algorithm was omitted from subsequent large-scale studies.

 Note that the datasets follow a similar pattern, with the exception of
 the Fake News data sets, where the parametric uncertainty (now represented
 only by the warm start MC dropout strategy) is beneficial, and HAC batch
 selection strategy has a negative effect (probably due to preference of
 large clusters).

Acquisition functions:

Due to binary classification, the min-margin and entropy approaches coincide
 for a single network function.
 The difference between our generalization of Entropy and BALD methods for
 the ensemble techniques seems insignificant, Figure

 HAC methods perform well for some cases, but a simple entropy approach
 shows more stable results for the majority of problems, batch sizes, and
 initializations.

Initialization of the training: 
\series default
The proposed modification on warm start strategies (HAC Entropy, NN Entropy,
 and NN Random warm start) are better or comparable in performance to the
 cold start (HAC Min-margin, NN Entropy, NN Random); this is achieved at
 a fraction of the training cost.
 This indicates that the additive noise is sufficient to avoid overfitting
 of the hot start

\series bold
Batch selection strategy: 
\series default
The HAC batch selection has a clear advantage for smaller batch sizes (10
 and 20).
 This is consistent when comparing HAC and Top variants of all methods except
 Fake News Detection.
 Smaller batch sizes and the proposed generalization to warm start HAC outperfor
ms the cold start approach in most of cases.
 The batch advantage diminishes for sizes of 50 and 100 where the top selection
 strategy achieves comparable (ensembles) or better (single NN) results.
 We project that the most informative samples in our datasets are clustered
 in small groups, hence the selection of a batch with a large enough size
 contains all important samples.

The contribution of this paper lies in a comparative study where we decomposed
 different algorithms into building blocks and generalized various approaches.
 For a better understanding of the methodology, we selected some approaches
 for demonstration.
 In Figure

 a comparison of various active learning sequences is displayed.
 More specifically, the methods proposed by us to well studied HAC min-margin
 approach.
 The uncertainty bounds in the figure are illustrated as one standard deviation
 from the mean value with respect to 5 runs.
 All algorithms were initially trained on 10 labeled text documents before
 sequential learning strategies were initialized.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have studied the influence of various factors (i.
 e.
 acquisition functions, batch sizes, neural networks initialization) of
 active learning algorithms and their performance on cover context integrity,
 fake news detection, and sentiment classification tasks.
 While complex algorithms such as deep ensembles (DEnFi and Dropout MC)
 sometimes achieve good performance (Fake News detection), the winner, on
 average, is the classical prediction entropy of a single neural network
 with a few proposed modifications like warm start.
 Although the performance of the warm start method can sometimes be the
 same assume the cold start, the undeniable benefit is a lower computational
 cost.
 The selection of the batch size for annotation is also important.
 The agglomerative clustering improves performance for smaller batch sizes
 and may show better results than a more general method like entropy sampling.
